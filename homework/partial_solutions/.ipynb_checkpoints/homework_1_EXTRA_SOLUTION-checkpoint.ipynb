    "A common practice among composers is to encode messages into their music. Bach, for example, famously wrote his name into several of his pieces. The following cell builds a dictionary that maps each letter in the alphabet to its numerical position (A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, etc). I've randomly translated a couple characters to illustrate this. Run the following cell to store the dict in memory, and I'll meet you on the other side."

There's luckily a quick fix from this: the modulo operator (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).
